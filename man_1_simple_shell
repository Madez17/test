OPTIONS

All  of  the  single-character  shell  options  documented  in the description of the set builtin command can be used as options when the shell is invoked.  In addition, bash interprets the following options when it is invoked:


FORMAT controls the output as in c printf. Interpreted sequences are:
 
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -ls 
- list of files
.IP --ls
-la --- list of file all in long format
.IP --/bin/ls 
print string.
.IP --/bin/ls 
-la print only char
.IP --%i
takes integer value as integer value with decimal, hexadecimal or octal type.
.IP --%d
takes integer value as signed decimal integer i.e. it takes negative values along with positive values but values should be in decimal otherwise it will print garbage value.

ARGUMENTS
The first argument is assumed to be the  name
of a file containing shell commands.  If shell is invoked in this fashion, $0 is set to the name of the file, and the positional parameters are set
to the remaining arguments.  shell reads and executes commands from this file, then exits.  shell's exit status is the exit status of the last  command  executed in the script.  If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0.  An attempt is first made to open the file in the current directory, and, if no file is found, then the shell searches the directories in PATH for the script.
